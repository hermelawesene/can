        <h1>About Cancer Detection System</h1>
        
        <section>
            <h2>Our Mission</h2>
            <p>Our mission is to provide a reliable, accessible, and fast way to assist in the early detection of cancer through the use of advanced AI technology. By harnessing the power of machine learning and image analysis, our system aims to help patients and healthcare providers identify cancer signs as early as possible, potentially improving outcomes and saving lives.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>How It Works</h2>
            <p>This Cancer Detection System uses artificial intelligence to analyze X-ray images for indications of cancer. When an image is uploaded, our system performs the following:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><B>Image Preprocessing</B>: Ensures the uploaded image is ready for analysis by converting it into a format the AI model can interpret.</li>
                <li><b>Cancer Classification</b>: The system identifies whether the image shows signs of Brain Cancer, Bone Cancer, or Breast Cancer, based on predefined patterns learned from a vast dataset of medical images.</li>
                <li><B>Stage Prediction</B>: If cancer is detected, the system estimates its level, ranging from early to advanced stages, providing valuable insights for further medical assessment.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Why Choose Our System?</h2>
            <p>Early detection of cancer can significantly improve treatment success rates. This system provides users with:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Accuracy</b>: Our AI model has been trained on thousands of medical images to deliver reliable results.</li>
                <li><b>Accessibility</b>: The platform is designed to be user-friendly and accessible from any device with internet connectivity.</li>
                <li><b>Privacy</b>: We prioritize user privacy by securely processing images and ensuring that no data is stored beyond the analysis session.</li>
                <li><b>Speed</b>: The AI model is capable of delivering results in seconds, allowing users to quickly know if further medical consultation may be needed.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Limitations</h2>
            <p>While this system is designed to provide accurate predictions, it is not a substitute for professional medical diagnosis. It is recommended to consult a healthcare provider for comprehensive diagnostic tests and expert advice if any issues are detected.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Future Development</h2>
            <p>We continuously work to improve our cancer detection model by incorporating additional data sources, enhancing accuracy, and adding more cancer types and stage-specific predictions. Our vision is to expand the system's capabilities to support other forms of medical imaging and assist in diagnosing a wider range of conditions.</p>
